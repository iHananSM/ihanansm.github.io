I'm currently an `Associate Researcher` at `AI and Robotics Institute` at King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (`KACST`) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. I earned my MSc. in Computer Science from King Saud University in 2024, after completing my BSc. in Computer Science and Information from King Saud University in 2017. My research focuses on machine learning algorithms and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Iâ€™ve been building on these interests since my undergraduate years, and I continue to explore them through my work at KACST.
